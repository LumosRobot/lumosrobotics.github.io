Lumos RL Workspace is a modular reinforcement learning framework for legged locomotion, designed around the Lus and NIX humanoid robots.
Built on Isaac Lab, it decouples policy development from specific simulators, supporting seamless integration with both Isaac Sim and MuJoCo.
Key features include:
- Modularity & Flexibility – controllers are isolated from the simulator core, enabling easy extension and platform switching.
- Imitation-based Learning – with motion references and adaptive curricula, policies can capture natural, human-like movements.
- General Interfaces – velocity and style commands, reward terms, and robot-specific modules simplify adaptation to new robots.
- Evaluation & Benchmarking – standardized tests across terrains, tasks, and styles enable robustness, generalization, and sim-to-real studies.
In short, Lumos RL Workspace is a simulation-agnostic, extensible platform for advancing locomotion policy research and deployment.
Using this guide, you will be able to  retarget human motions, train locomotion policies, and deploy them to the Lus2 and Nix1 humanoid robots.
